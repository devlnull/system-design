# Non-Functional Requirements

## Performance
- [TBD] P50/P95/P99 latency targets by endpoint or workflow.

## Availability and Reliability
- [TBD] Target uptime (e.g., 99.9%), failover strategy.

## Scalability
- [TBD] Expected growth, scale-out strategy, peak traffic.

## Durability and Backup
- [TBD] Data retention, backup frequency, RPO/RTO.

## Consistency
- [TBD] Strong vs eventual consistency needs per workflow.

## Security
- [TBD] Authn/authz, encryption in transit/at rest, secrets handling.

## Privacy and Compliance
- [TBD] GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, PCI, data residency.

## Observability
- [TBD] Metrics, logs, traces, alerting requirements.

## Maintainability
- [TBD] Modularity, documentation, runbooks.

## Cost Constraints
- [TBD] Budget targets, unit economics, cost guards.

## Accessibility and UX
- [TBD] Accessibility standards, response UX constraints.

## Internationalization
- [TBD] Locale, time zone, currency needs.

## Operational Constraints
